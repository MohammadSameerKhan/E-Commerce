# E-Commerce

When shopping online, you select items and add them to a shopping cart. Duplicate items
are permitted in a shopping cart, as you can purchase multiples of the same item. You
also can remove an item from a shopping cart, if you change your mind about buying it.
The shopping cart can show its current contents with their prices and the total cost of
these items. Design the ADT item and shopping cart.
